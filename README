Build instructions
==================

Download and install "netbeans 6.8 - JAVA". When installing choose
to install the "tomcat" server somewhere.

Start netbeans and add the projects "core", "admin" and "search"
projects and you're ready to build. Remember that you need to build
"core" first.

Alternatively you can call "make" and "make install" in every sub
directory - if you don't want to remember how to call "mvn" and "ant".

After running "make install" you find a top level "build" directory
which contains the jar and war files. Additionally there's a "run.sh"
script that can start the core part.

Before running, you should read

http://www.openbenno.org/category/installation/

for basic installation instructions.
